  <a name="PREFACE"></a>

  <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>I had intended translating all or nearly all these Idylls into
  blank verse, as the natural equivalent of Greek or of Latin
  hexameters; only deviating into rhyme where occasion seemed to
  demand it. But I found that other metres had their special
  advantages: the fourteen-syllable line in particular has that,
  among others, of containing about the same number of syllables as
  an ordinary line of Theocritus. And there is also no doubt
  something gained by variety.</p>

  <p>Several recent writers on the subject have laid down that
  every translation of Greek poetry, especially bucolic poetry,
  must be in rhyme of some sort. But they have seldom stated, and
  it is hard to see, why. There is no rhyme in the original, and
  <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> should be none in the translation.
  Professor Blackie has, it is true, pointed out the "assonances,
  alliterations, and rhymes," which are found in more or less
  abundance in Ionic Greek.<a name="FNanchorA"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_A"><sup>[A]</sup></a> These may of course be purely
  accidental, like the hexameters in Livy or the blank-verse lines
  in Mr. Dickens's prose: but accidental or not (it may be said)
  they are there, and ought to be recognised. May we not then
  recognise them by introducing similar assonances, etc., here and
  there into the English version? or by availing ourselves of what
  Professor Blackie again calls attention to, the "compensating
  powers"<a name="FNanchorB"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_B"><sup>[B]</sup></a> of English? I think with him
  that it was hard to speak of our language as one which
  "transforms <i>boos megaloio boei&eacute;n</i> into 'great ox's
  hide.'" Such phrases as 'The Lord is a man of war,' 'The trumpet
  spake not to the armed throng,' are to my ear quite as grand as
  Homer: and it would be equally fair to ask what we are to make of
  a language which transforms Milton's line into [Greek: &ecirc;
  shalpigx ohy prosheph&ecirc; ton h&ocirc;plismhenon
  hochlon.]<a name="FNanchorC"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_C"><sup>[C]</sup></a> But be this as it may, these
  phenomena are surely too rare and too arbitrary to be adequately
  represented by any regularly recurring rhyme: and the question
  remains, what is there in the unrhymed original to which rhyme
  answers?</p>

  <p>To me its effect is to divide the verse into couplets,
  triplets, or (if the word may include them all) <i>stanzas</i> of
  some kind. Without rhyme we have no apparent means of conveying
  the effect of stanzas. There are of course devices such as
  repeating a line or part of a line at stated intervals, as is
  done in 'Tears, idle tears' and elsewhere: but clearly none of
  these would be available to a translator. Where therefore he has
  to express stanzas, it is easy to see that rhyme may be
  admissible and even necessary. Pope's couplet may (or may not)
  stand for elegiacs, and the <i>In Memoriam</i> stanza for some
  one of Horace's metres. Where the heroes of Virgil's Eclogues
  sing alternately four lines each, Gray's quatrain seems to
  suggest itself: and where a similar case occurs in these Idylls
  (as for instance in the ninth) I thought it might be met by
  taking whatever received English stanza was nearest the required
  length. Pope's couplet again may possibly best convey the
  pomposity of some Idylls and the point of others. And there may
  be divers considerations of this kind. But, speaking generally,
  where the translator has not to intimate stanzas&mdash;where he
  has on the contrary to intimate that there are none&mdash;rhyme
  seems at first sight an intrusion and a <i>suggestio
  falsi</i>.</p>

  <p>No doubt (as has been observed) what 'Pastorals' we have are
  mostly written in what is called the heroic measure. But the
  reason is, I suppose, not far to seek. Dryden and Pope wrote
  'heroics,' not from any sense of their fitness for bucolic
  poetry, but from a sense of their universal fitness: and their
  followers copied them. But probably no scholar would affirm that
  any poem, original or translated, by Pope or Dryden or any of
  their school, really resembles in any degree the bucolic poetry
  of the Greeks. Mr. Morris, whose poems appear to me to resemble
  it more almost than anything I have ever seen, of course writes
  what is technically Pope's metre, and equally of course is not of
  Pope's school. Whether or no Pope and Dryden <i>intended</i> to
  resemble the old bucolic poets in style is, to say the least,
  immaterial. If they did not, there is no reason whatever why any
  of us who do should adopt their metre: if they did and failed,
  there is every reason why we should select a different one.</p>

  <p>Professor Conington has adduced one cogent argument against
  blank verse: that is, that hardly any of us can write it.<a name=
  "FNanchorD"></a><a href="#Footnote_D"><sup>[D]</sup></a> But if
  this is so&mdash;if the 'blank verse' which we write is virtually
  prose in disguise&mdash;the addition of rhyme would only make it
  rhymed prose, and we should be as far as ever from "verse really
  deserving the name."<a name="FNanchorE"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_E"><sup>[E]</sup></a> Unless (which I can hardly
  imagine) the mere incident of 'terminal consonance' can
  constitute that verse which would not be verse independently,
  this argument is equally good against attempting verse of any
  kind: we should still be writing disguised, and had better write
  undisguised, prose. Prose translations are of course tenable, and
  are (I am told) advocated by another very eminent critic. These
  considerations against them occur to one: that, among the
  characteristics of his original which the translator is bound to
  preserve, one is that he wrote metrically; and that the prattle
  which passes muster, and sounds perhaps rather pretty than
  otherwise, in metre, would in plain prose be insufferable. Very
  likely some exceptional sort of prose may be meant, which would
  dispose of all such difficulties: but this would be harder for an
  ordinary writer to evolve out of his own brain, than to construct
  any species of verse for which he has at least a model and a
  precedent.</p>

  <p>These remarks are made to shew that my metres were not
  selected, as it might appear, at hap-hazard. Metre is not so
  unimportant as to justify that. For the rest, I have used
  Briggs's edition<a name="FNanchorF"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_F"><sup>[F]</sup></a> (<i>Poet&aelig; Bucolici
  Gr&aelig;ci</i>), and have never, that I am aware of, taken
  refuge in any various reading where I could make any sense at all
  of the text as given by him. Sometimes I have been content to put
  down what I felt was a wrong rendering rather than omit; but only
  in cases where the original was plainly corrupt, and all
  suggested emendations seemed to me hopelessly wide of the mark.
  What, for instance, may be the true meaning of [Greek: bolbhost
  tist kochlhiast] in the fourteenth Idyll I have no idea. It is
  not very important. And no doubt the sense of the last two lines
  of the "<i>Death of Adonis</i>" is very unlikely to be what I
  have made it. But no suggestion that I met with seemed to me
  satisfactory or even plausible: and in this and a few similar
  cases I have put down what suited the context. Occasionally also,
  as in the Idyll here printed last&mdash;the one lately discovered
  by Bergk, which I elucidated by the light of Fritzsche's
  conjectures&mdash;I have availed myself of an opinion which
  Professor Conington somewhere expresses, to the effect that,
  where two interpretations are tenable, it is lawful to accept for
  the purposes of translation the one you might reject as a
  commentator. [Greek: tetootaiost] has I dare say nothing whatever
  to do with 'quartan fever.'</p>

  <p>On one point, rather a minor one, I have ventured to dissent
  from Professor Blackie and others: namely, in retaining the
  Greek, instead of adopting the Roman, nomenclature. Professor
  Blackie says<a name="FNanchorG"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_G"><sup>[G]</sup></a> that there are some men by whom
  "it is esteemed a grave offence to call Jupiter Jupiter," which
  begs the question: and that Jove "is much more musical" than
  Zeus, which begs another. Granting (what might be questioned)
  that <i>Zeus, Aphrodite</i>, and <i>Eros</i> are as absolutely
  the same individuals with <i>Jupiter, Venus</i>, and <i>Cupid</i>
  as <i>Odysseus</i> undoubtedly is with <i>Ulysses</i>&mdash;still
  I cannot see why, in making a version of (say) Theocritus, one
  should not use by way of preference those names by which he
  invariably called them, and which are characteristic of him: why,
  in turning a Greek author into English, we should begin by
  turning all the proper names into Latin. Professor Blackie's
  authoritative statement<a name="FNanchorH"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_H"><sup>[H]</sup></a> that "there are whole idylls in
  Theocritus which would sound ridiculous in any other language
  than that of Tam o' Shanter" I accept of course unhesitatingly,
  and should like to see it acted upon by himself or any competent
  person. But a translator is bound to interpret all as best he
  may: and an attempt to write Tam o' Shanter's language by one who
  was not Tam o' Shanter's countryman would, I fear, result in
  something more ridiculous still.</p>

      <p>(In might a youngster yet) the sinews swell.</p>

      <p>Hard by that wave-beat sire a vineyard bends</p>

      <p>Beneath its graceful load of burnished grapes;</p>

      <p>A boy sits on the rude fence watching them.</p>

      <p>Near him two foxes: down the rows of grapes</p>

      <p>One ranging steals the ripest; one assails</p>

      <p>With wiles the poor lad's scrip, to leave him soon</p>

      <p>Stranded and supperless. He plaits meanwhile</p>

      <p>With ears of corn a right fine cricket-trap,</p>

      <p>And fits it on a rush: for vines, for scrip,</p>

      <p>Little he cares, enamoured of his toy.</p>

      <p class="i2">The cup is hung all round with lissom
      briar,</p>

      <p>Triumph of &AElig;olian art, a wondrous sight.</p>

      <p>It was a ferryman's of Calydon:</p>

      <p>A goat it cost me, and a great white cheese.</p>

      <p>Ne'er yet my lips came near it, virgin still</p>

      <p>It stands. And welcome to such boon art thou,</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland

      <p>Where are the bay-leaves, Thestylis, and the charms?</p>

      <p>Fetch all; with fiery wool the caldron crown;</p>

      <p>Let glamour win me back my false lord's heart!</p>

      <p>Twelve days the wretch hath not come nigh to me,</p>

      <p>Nor made enquiry if I die or live,</p>

      <p>Nor clamoured (oh unkindness!) at my door.</p>

      <p>Sure his swift fancy wanders otherwhere,</p>

      <p>The slave of Aphrodit&egrave; and of Love.</p>

      <p>I'll off to Timagetus' wrestling-school</p>

      <p>At dawn, that I may see him and denounce</p>

      <p>His doings; but I'll charm him now with charms.</p>

      <p>So shine out fair, O moon! To thee I sing</p>

      <p>My soft low song: to thee and Hecat&egrave;</p>

      <p>The dweller in the shades, at whose approach</p>

      <p>E'en the dogs quake, as on she moves through blood</p>

      <p>And darkness and the barrows of the slain.</p>

      <p>All hail, dread Hecat&egrave;: companion me</p>

      <p>Unto the end, and work me witcheries</p>

      <p>Potent as Circ&egrave; or Medea wrought,</p>

      <p>Or Perimed&egrave; of the golden hair!</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>First we ignite the grain. Nay, pile it on:</p>

      <p>Where are thy wits flown, timorous Thestylis?</p>

      <p>Shall I be flouted, I, by such as thou?</p>

      <p>Pile, and still say, 'This pile is of his bones.'</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>Delphis racks me: I burn him in these bays.</p>

      <p>As, flame-enkindled, they lift up their voice,</p>

      <p>Blaze once, and not a trace is left behind:</p>

      <p>So waste his flesh to powder in yon fire!</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>E'en as I melt, not uninspired, the wax,</p>

      <p>May Mindian Delphis melt this hour with love:</p>

      <p>And, swiftly as this brazen wheel whirls round,</p>

      <p>May Aphrodit&egrave; whirl him to my door.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>Next burn the husks. Hell's adamantine floor</p>

      <p>And aught that else stands firm can Artemis move.</p>

      <p>Thestylis, the hounds bay up and down the town:</p>

      <p>The goddess stands i' the crossroads: sound the gongs.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>Hushed are the voices of the winds and seas;</p>

      <p>But O not hushed the voice of my despair.</p>

      <p>He burns my being up, who left me here</p>

      <p>No wife, no maiden, in my misery.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>Thrice I pour out; speak thrice, sweet mistress, thus:</p>

      <p>"What face soe'er hangs o'er him be forgot</p>

      <p>Clean as, in Dia, Theseus (legends say)</p>

      <p>Forgat his Ariadne's locks of love."</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic, wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>The coltsfoot grows in Arcady, the weed</p>

      <p>That drives the mountain-colts and swift mares wild.</p>

      <p>Like them may Delphis rave: so, maniac-wise,</p>

      <p>Race from his burnished brethren home to me.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>He lost this tassel from his robe; which I</p>

      <p>Shred thus, and cast it on the raging flames.</p>

      <p>Ah baleful Love! why, like the marsh-born leech,</p>

      <p>Cling to my flesh, and drain my dark veins dry?</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>From a crushed eft tomorrow he shall drink</p>

      <p>Death! But now, Thestylis, take these herbs and smear</p>

      <p>That threshold o'er, whereto at heart I cling</p>

      <p>Still, still&mdash;albeit he thinks scorn of me&mdash;</p>

      <p>And spit, and say, ''Tis Delphis' bones I smear.'</p>

      <p>Now, all alone, I'll weep a love whence sprung</p>

      <p>When born? Who wrought my sorrow? Anaxo came,</p>

      <p>Her basket in her hand, to Artemis' grove.</p>

      <p>Bound for the festival, troops of forest beasts</p>

      <p>Stood round, and in the midst a lioness.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my

      <p>Theucharidas' slave, my Thracian nurse now dead</p>

      <p>Then my near neighbour, prayed me and implored</p>

      <p>To see the pageant: I, the poor doomed thing,</p>

      <p>Went with her, trailing a fine silken train,</p>

      <p>And gathering round me Clearista's robe.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my

      <p>Now, the mid-highway reached by Lycon's farm,</p>

      <p>Delphis and Eudamippus passed me by.</p>

      <p>With beards as lustrous as the woodbine's gold</p>

      <p>And breasts more sheeny than thyself, O Moon,</p>

      <p>Fresh from the wrestler's glorious toil they came.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>I saw, I raved, smit (weakling) to my heart.</p>

      <p>My beauty withered, and I cared no more</p>

      <p>For all that pomp; and how I gained my home</p>

      <p>I know not: some strange fever wasted me.</p>

      <p>Ten nights and days I lay upon my bed.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>And wan became my flesh, as 't had been dyed,</p>

      <p>And all my hair streamed off, and there was left</p>

      <p>But bones and skin. Whose threshold crossed I not,</p>

      <p>Or missed what grandam's hut who dealt in charms?</p>

      <p>For no light thing was this, and time sped on.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>At last I spake the truth to that my maid:</p>

      <p>"Seek, an thou canst, some cure for my sore pain.</p>

      <p>Alas, I am all the Mindian's! But begone,</p>

      <p>And watch by Timagetus' wrestling-school:</p>

      <p>There doth he haunt, there soothly take his rest.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>"Find him alone: nod softly: say, 'she waits';</p>

      <p>And bring him." So I spake: she went her way,</p>

      <p>And brought the lustrous-limbed one to my roof.</p>

      <p>And I, the instant I beheld him step</p>

      <p>Lightfooted o'er the threshold of my door,</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>,)</p>

      <p>Became all cold like snow, and from my brow</p>

      <p>Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,</p>

      <p>Not e'en such utterance as a babe may make</p>

      <p>That babbles to its mother in its dreams;</p>

      <p>But all my fair frame stiffened into wax.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>He bent his pitiless eyes on me; looked down,</p>

      <p>And sate him on my couch, and sitting, said:</p>

      <p>"Thou hast gained on me, Sim&aelig;tha, (e'en as I</p>

      <p>Bidding me hither ere I came unasked.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my

      <p>"For I had come, by Eros I had come,</p>

      <p>This night, with comrades twain or may-be more,</p>

      <p>The fruitage of the Wine-god in my robe,</p>

      <p>And, wound about my brow with ribands red,</p>

      <p>The silver leaves so dear to Heracles.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my

      <p>"Had ye said 'Enter,' well: for 'mid my peers</p>

      <p>High is my name for goodliness and speed:</p>

      <p>I had kissed that sweet mouth once and gone my way.</p>

      <p>But had the door been barred, and I thrust out,</p>

      <p>With brand and axe would we have stormed ye then.</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.</p>

      <p>"Now be my thanks recorded, first to Love,</p>

      <p>Next to thee, maiden, who didst pluck me out,</p>

      <p>A half-burned helpless creature, from the flames,</p>

      <p>And badst me hither. It is Love that lights</p>

      <p>A fire more fierce than his of Lipara;</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my
      love</i>.)</p>

      <p>"Scares, mischief-mad, the maiden from her bower,</p>

      <p>The bride from her warm couch." He spake: and I,</p>

      <p>A willing listener, sat, my hand in his,</p>

      <p>Among the cushions, and his cheek touched mine,</p>

      <p>Each hotter than its wont, and we discoursed</p>

      <p>In soft low language. Need I prate to thee,</p>

      <p>Sweet Moon, of all we said and all we did?</p>

      <p>Till yesterday he found no fault with me,</p>

      <p>Nor I with him. But lo, to-day there came</p>

      <p>Philista's mother&mdash;hers who flutes to me&mdash;</p>

      <p>With her Melampo's; just when up the sky</p>

      <p>Gallop the mares that chariot rose-limbed Dawn:</p>

      <p>And divers tales she brought me, with the rest</p>

      <p>How Delphis loved, she knew not rightly whom:</p>

      <p>But this she knew; that of the rich wine, aye</p>

      <p>He poured 'to Love;' and at the last had fled,</p>

      <p>To line, she deemed, the fair one's hall with flowers.</p>

      <p>Such was my visitor's tale, and it was true:</p>

      <p>For thrice, nay four times, daily he would stroll</p>

      <p>Hither, leave here full oft his Dorian flask:</p>

      <p>Now&mdash;'tis a fortnight since I saw his face.</p>

      <p>Doth he then treasure something sweet elsewhere?</p>

      <p>Am I forgot? I'll charm him now with charms.</p>

      <p>I pipe to Amaryllis; while my goats,</p>

      <p>Tityrus their guardian, browse along the fell.</p>

      <p>O Tityrus, as I love thee, feed my goats:</p>

      <p class="i2">Ah winsome Amaryllis! Why no more</p>

      <p>Greet'st thou thy darling, from the caverned rock</p>

      <p>Peeping all coyly? Think'st thou scorn of him?</p>

      <p>Hath a near view revealed him satyr-shaped</p>

      <p>I plucked them: I shall bring ten more anon.</p>

      <p>Ah witness my heart-anguish! Oh were I</p>

      <p>Threading the fern and ivy in whose depths</p>

      <p>Thou nestlest! I have learned what Love is now:</p>

      <p>Fell god, he drank the lioness's milk,</p>

      <p>In the wild woods his mother cradled him,</p>

      <p>Whose fire slow-burns me, smiting to the bone.</p>

      <p>All marble: O dark-eyebrowed maiden mine!</p>

      <p>Cling to thy goatherd, let him kiss thy lips,</p>

      <p>For there is sweetness in an empty kiss.</p>

      <p>Thou wilt not? Piecemeal I will rend the crown,</p>

      <p>Inwov'n with scented parsley and with flowers:</p>

      <p>Oh I am desperate&mdash;what betides me, what?&mdash;</p>

      <p>Still art thou deaf? I'll doff my coat of skins</p>

      <p>For mackerel Olpis sits: tho' I 'scape death,</p>

      <p>Daphnis, the gentle herdsman, met once, as legend
      tells,</p>

      <p>Menalcas making with his flock the circle of the
      fells.</p>

      <p>Both chins were gilt with coming beards: both lads could

      <p>Menalcas glanced at Daphnis, and thus was heard to
      say:&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Art thou for singing, Daphnis, lord of the lowing
      kine?</p>

      <p>I say my songs are better, by what thou wilt, than
      thine."</p>

      <p>Then in his turn spake Daphnis, and thus he made
      reply:</p>

      <p>"O shepherd of the fleecy flock, thou pipest clear and
      high;</p>

      <p>But come what will, Menalcas, thou ne'er wilt sing as

      <p>Methinks all nature hath no cure for Love,</p>

      <p>Plaster or unguent, Nicias, saving one;</p>

      <p>And this is light and pleasant to a man,</p>

      <p>Yet hard withal to compass&mdash;minstrelsy.</p>

      <p>As well thou wottest, being thyself a leech,</p>

      <p>And a prime favourite of those Sisters nine.</p>

      <p>'Twas thus our Giant lived a life of ease,</p>

      <p>Old Polyphemus, when, the down scarce seen</p>

      <p>On lip and chin, he wooed his ocean nymph:</p>

      <p>No curlypated rose-and-apple wooer,</p>

      <p>But a fell madman, blind to all but love.</p>

      <p>Oft from the green grass foldward fared his sheep</p>

      <p>Unbid: while he upon the windy beach,</p>

      <p>Singing his Galatea, sat and pined</p>

      <p>From dawn to dusk, an ulcer at his heart:</p>

      <p>Great Aphrodite's shaft had fixed it there.</p>

      <p>Yet found he that one cure: he sate him down</p>

      <p>On the tall cliff, and seaward looked, and
      sang:&mdash;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"White Galatea, why disdain thy love?</p>

      <p>White as a pressed cheese, delicate as the lamb,</p>

      <p>Wild as the heifer, soft as summer grapes!</p>

      <p>If sweet sleep chain me, here thou walk'st at large;</p>

      <p>If sweet sleep loose me, straightway thou art gone,</p>

      <p>Scared like a sheep that sees the grey wolf near.</p>

      <p>I loved thee, maiden, when thou cam'st long since,</p>

      <p>To pluck the hyacinth-blossom on the fell,</p>

      <p>Thou and my mother, piloted by me.</p>

      <p>I saw thee, see thee still, from that day forth</p>

      <p>For ever; but 'tis naught, ay naught, to thee.</p>

      <p>I know, sweet maiden, why thou art so coy:</p>

      <p>Shaggy and huge, a single eyebrow spans</p>

      <p>From ear to ear my forehead, whence one eye</p>

      <p>Gleams, and an o'erbroad nostril tops my lip.</p>

      <p>Yet I, this monster, feed a thousand sheep</p>

      <p>That yield me sweetest draughts at milking-tide:</p>

      <p>In summer, autumn, or midwinter, still</p>

      <p>Fails not my cheese; my milkpail aye o'erflows.</p>

      <p>Then I can pipe as ne'er did Giant yet,</p>

      <p>Singing our loves&mdash;ours, honey, thine and
      mine&mdash;</p>

      <p>At dead of night: and hinds I rear eleven</p>

      <p>(Each with her fawn) and bearcubs four, for thee.</p>

      <p>And let the mad seas beat against the shore!</p>

      <p>And vines of sumptuous fruitage, all are there:</p>

      <p>And a cold spring that pine-clad &AElig;tna flings</p>

      <p>Denied thy lips&mdash;and bring thee lilies white</p>

      <p>All songs whereby himself had risen to fame;</p>

      <p class="i2">Nor ever from his side would be beguiled</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nor when the hen's shrill brood becomes aware</p>

      <p class="i2">Of bed-time, as the mother's flapping wings</p>

      <p>Shadow the dust-browned beam. 'Twas all his care</p>

      <p class="i2">To shape unto his own imaginings</p>

      <p>And to the harness train his favourite youth,</p>

      <p>Till he became a man in very truth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Meanwhile, when kingly Jason steered in quest</p>

      <p class="i2">Of the Gold Fleece, and chieftains at his
      side</p>

      <p>Chosen from all cities, proffering each her best,</p>

      <p class="i2">To rich Iolchos came that warrior tried,</p>

      <p>Through the great gulf shot Argo like a bird&mdash;</p>

      <p>But now, when waned the spring, and lambs were fed</p>

      <p>In far-off fields, and Pleiads gleamed overhead,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>That cream and flower of knighthood looked to sail.</p>

      <p class="i2">They came, within broad Argo safely stowed,</p>

      <p>(When for three days had blown the southern gale)</p>

      <p class="i2">To Hellespont, and in Propontis rode</p>

      <p>At anchor, where Cianian oxen now</p>

      <p>Broaden the furrows with the busy plough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>They leapt ashore, and, keeping rank, prepared</p>

      <p class="i2">Their evening meal: a grassy meadow spread</p>

      <p>Before their eyes, and many a warrior shared</p>

      <p class="i2">(Thanks to its verdurous stores) one lowly
      bed.</p>

      <p>And while they cut tall marigolds from their stem</p>

      <p>And sworded bulrush, Hylas slipt from them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Water the fair lad wont to seek and bring</p>

      <p class="i2">Bearing a brazen pitcher. And anon,</p>

      <p>Where the ground dipt, a fountain he espied,</p>

      <p>And rushes growing green about its side.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There rose the sea-blue swallow-wort, and there</p>

      <p class="i2">The pale-hued maidenhair, with parsley
      green</p>

      <p>And vagrant marsh-flowers; and a revel rare</p>

      <p class="i2">In the pool's midst the water-nymphs were
      seen</p>

      <p>To hold, those maidens of unslumbrous eyes</p>

      <p>Whom the belated peasant sees and flies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And fast did Malis and Eunica cling,</p>

      <p>To the lad's hand, as stooping o'er the spring</p>

      <p class="i2">He dipt his pitcher. For the young Greek's
      grace</p>

      <p>Made their soft senses reel; and down he fell,</p>

      <p>All of a sudden, into that black well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>So drops a red star suddenly from sky</p>

      <p class="i2">To sea&mdash;and quoth some sailor to his
      mate:</p>

      <p>"Up with the tackle, boy! the breeze is high."</p>

      <p class="i2">Him the nymphs pillowed, all disconsolate,</p>

      <p>On their sweet laps, and with soft words beguiled;</p>

      <p>But Heracles was troubled for the child.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Forth went he; Scythian-wise his bow he bore</p>

      <p class="i2">And the great club that never quits his

      <p>And thrice called 'Hylas'&mdash;ne'er came lustier
      roar</p>

      <p class="i2">From that deep chest. Thrice Hylas heard and
      tried</p>

      <p>To answer, but in tones you scarce might hear;</p>

      <p>The water made them distant though so near.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And as a lion, when he hears the bleat</p>

      <p class="i2">Of fawns among the mountains far away,</p>

      <p>A murderous lion, and with hurrying feet</p>

      <p class="i2">Bounds from his lair to his predestined
      prey:</p>

      <p>So plunged the strong man in the untrodden

      <p>(Lovers are maniacs)&mdash;for his darling's sake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He scoured far fields&mdash;what hill or oaken glen</p>

      <p class="i2">Remembers not that pilgrimage of pain?</p>

      <p>His troth to Jason was forgotten then.</p>

      <p class="i2">Long time the good ship tarried for those
      twain</p>

      <p>With hoisted sails; night came and still they cleared</p>

      <p>The hatches, but no Heracles appeared.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>On he was wandering, reckless where he trod,</p>

      <p>While Hylas had become a blessed god.</p>

      <p class="i2">But the crew cursed the runaway who had

      <p>The world must wag. But what's thy grievance now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&AElig;SCHINES.</p>

      <p>That Argive, Apis the Thessalian Knight,</p>

      <p>Myself, and gallant Cleonicus, supped</p>

      <p>Within my grounds. Two pullets I had slain,</p>

      <p>And a prime pig: and broached my Biblian wine;</p>

      <p>'Twas four years old, but fragrant as when new.</p>

      <p>Truffles were served to us: and the drink was good.</p>

      <p>Well, we got on, and each must drain a cup</p>

      <p>To whom he fancied; only each must name.</p>

      <p>We named, and took our liquor as ordained;</p>

      <p>But she sate silent&mdash;this before my face.</p>

      <p>Fancy my feelings! "Wilt not speak? Hast seen</p>

      <p>A wolf?" some wag said. "Shrewdly guessed," quoth she,</p>

      <p>And blushed&mdash;her blushes might have fired a
      torch.</p>

      <p>A wolf <i>had</i> charmed her: Wolf her neighbour's
      son,</p>

      <p>Goodly and tall, and fair in divers eyes:</p>

      <p>For his illustrious sake it was she pined.</p>

      <p>This had been breathed, just idly, in my ear:</p>

      <p>Shame on my beard, I ne'er pursued the hint.</p>

      <p>Well, when we four were deep amid our cups,</p>

      <p>The Knight must sing 'The Wolf' (a local song)</p>

      <p>Right through for mischief. All at once she wept</p>

      <p>Hot tears as girls of six years old might weep,</p>

      <p>Clinging and clamouring round their mother's lap.</p>

      <p>And I, (you know my humour, friend of mine,)</p>

      <p>Drove at his face, one, two! She gathered up</p>

      <p>Her robes and vanished straightway through the door.</p>

      <p>"And so I fail to please, false lady mine?</p>

      <p>Another lies more welcome in thy lap?</p>

      <p>Go warm that other's heart: he'll say thy tears</p>

      <p>Are liquid pearls." And as a swallow flies</p>

      <p>Forth in a hurry, here or there to find</p>

      <p>A mouthful for her brood among the eaves:</p>

      <p>From her soft sofa passing-swift she fled</p>

      <p>Through folding-doors and hall, with random feet:</p>

      <p><i>'The stag had gained his heath':</i> you know the
      rest.</p>

      <p>Three weeks, a month, nine days and ten to that,</p>

      <p>To-day's the eleventh: and 'tis just two months</p>

      <p>All but two days, since she and I were two.</p>

      <p>Hence is my beard of more than Thracian growth.</p>

      <p>Now Wolf is all to her: Wolf enters in</p>

      <p>At midnight; I am a cypher in her eyes;</p>

      <p>The poor Megarian, nowhere in the race.</p>

      <p>All would go right, if I could once <i>unlove</i>:</p>

      <p>But now, you wot, the rat hath tasted tar.</p>

      <p>And what may cure a swain at his wit's end</p>

      <p>I know not: Simus, (true,) a mate of mine,</p>

      <p>Loved Epichalcus' daughter, and took ship</p>

      <p>And came home cured. I too will sail the seas.</p>

      <p>Worse men, it may be better, are afloat,</p>

      <p>I shall still prove an average man-at-arms.</p>

      <p>Now may thy love run smoothly, &AElig;schines!</p>

      <p>Loyal to ladies; one whose eye is keen</p>

      <p>Large in his bounties, he, in kingly sort,</p>

      <p>Denies a boon to none: but, &AElig;schines,</p>

      <p>One should not ask too often. This premised,</p>

      <p>If thou wilt clasp the military cloak</p>

      <p>O'er thy right shoulder, and with legs astride</p>

      <p>Await the onward rush of shielded men:</p>

      <p>Hie thee to Egypt. Age overtakes us all;</p>

      <p>Our temples first; then on o'er cheek and chin,</p>

      <p>All are his care, those chiefliest on whose birth</p>

      <p>He smiled: exceeding glory waits on them:</p>

      <p>Theirs is the sovereignty of land and sea.</p>

      <p>But if a myriad realms spread far and wide</p>

      <p>O'er earth, if myriad nations till the soil</p>

      <p>To which heaven's rain gives increase: yet what land</p>

      <p>Wells forth and piecemeal breaks the sodden glebe?</p>

      <p>Where are like cities, peopled by like men?</p>

      <p>Lo he hath seen three hundred towns arise,</p>

      <p>Three thousand, yea three myriad; and o'er all</p>

      <p>He rules, the prince of heroes, Ptolemy.</p>

      <p>Claims half Phoenicia, and half Araby,</p>

      <p>Light are all royal treasuries, weighed with his.</p>

      <p>For wealth from all climes travels day by day</p>

      <p>To his rich realm, a hive of prosperous peace.</p>

      <p>No foeman's tramp scares monster-peopled Nile,</p>

      <p>Waking to war her far-off villages:</p>

      <p>No armed robber from his war-ship leaps</p>

      <p>To spoil the herds of Egypt. Such a prince</p>

      <p>Quivers the spear, the bright-haired Ptolemy.</p>

      <p>Like a true king, he guards with might and main</p>

      <p>Nor strown all idly o'er his sumptuous halls</p>

      <p>Lie piles that seem the work of labouring ants.</p>

      <p>The holy homes of gods are rich therewith;</p>

      <p>Theirs are the firstfruits, earnest aye of more.</p>

      <p>And freely mighty kings thereof partake,</p>

      <p>Freely great cities, freely honoured friends.</p>

      <p>None entered e'er the sacred lists of song,</p>

      <p>Whose lips could breathe sweet music, but he gained</p>

      <p>Fair guerdon at the hand of Ptolemy.</p>

      <p>And Ptolemy do music's votaries hymn</p>

      <p>For his good gifts&mdash;hath man a fairer lot</p>

      <p>Than to have earned much fame among mankind?</p>

      <p>The Atrid&aelig;'s name abides, while all the wealth</p>

      <p>Won from the sack of Priam's stately home</p>

      <p>A mist closed o'er it, to be seen no more.</p>

      <p>Ptolemy, he only, treads a path whose dust</p>

      <p>Burns with the footprints of his ancestors,</p>

      <p>And overlays those footprints with his own.</p>

      <p>He raised rich shrines to mother and to sire,</p>

      <p>There reared their forms in ivory and gold,</p>

      <p>Passing in beauty, to befriend mankind.</p>

      <p>Thighs of fat oxen oftentimes he burns</p>

      <p>On crimsoning altars, as the months roll on,</p>

      <p>Ay he and his staunch wife. No fairer bride</p>

      <p>E'er clasped her lord in royal palaces:</p>

      <p>And her heart's love her brother-husband won.</p>

      <p>In such blest union joined the immortal pair</p>

      <p>The pair I sing, that &AElig;gis-arm&egrave;d Zeus</p>

      <p>Gave unto Leda; Castor and the dread</p>

      <p>Of bruisers Polydeuces, whensoe'er</p>

      <p>His harnessed hands were lifted for the fray.</p>

      <p>Twice and again I sing the manly sons</p>

      <p>Of Leda, those Twin Brethren, Sparta's own:</p>

      <p>Who shield the soldier on the deadly scarp,</p>

      <p>The horse wild-plunging o'er the crimson field,</p>

      <p>The ship that, disregarding in her pride</p>

      <p>Star-set and star-rise, meets disastrous gales:&mdash;</p>

      <p>Such gales as pile the billows mountain-high,</p>

      <p>E'en at their own wild will, round stem or stern:</p>

      <p>Dash o'er the hold, the timbers rive in twain,</p>

      <p>Till mast and tackle dangle in mid-air</p>

      <p>Shivered like toys, and, as the night wears on,</p>

      <p>The rain of heaven falls fast, and, lashed by wind</p>

      <p>And iron hail, broad ocean rings again.</p>

      <p>Then can they draw from out the nether abyss</p>

      <p>Both craft and crew, each deeming he must die:</p>

      <p>Lo the winds cease, and o'er the burnished deep</p>

      <p>Comes stillness; this way flee the clouds and that;</p>

      <p>And shine out clear the Great Bear and the Less,</p>

      <p>And, 'twixt the Asses dimly seen, the Crib</p>

      <p>Foretells fair voyage to the mariner.</p>

      <p>O saviours, O companions of mankind,</p>

      <p>Matchless on horse or harp, in lists or lay;</p>

      <p>Which of ye twain demands my earliest song?</p>

      <p>There by one ladder disembarked a host</p>

      <p>Of Heroes from the decks of Jason's ship.</p>

      <p>On the low beach, to leeward of the cliff,</p>

      <p>They leapt, and piled their beds, and lit their fires:</p>

      <p>Castor meanwhile, the bridler of the steed,</p>

      <p>And Polydeuces of the nut-brown face,</p>

      <p>Had wandered from their mates; and, wildered both,</p>

      <p>Searched through the boskage of the hill, and found</p>

      <p>Hard by a slab of rock a bubbling spring</p>

      <p>Brimful of purest water. In the depths</p>

      <p>Below, like crystal or like silver gleamed</p>

      <p>The pebbles: high above it pine and plane</p>

      <p>And poplar rose, and cypress tipt with green;</p>

      <p>With all rich flowers that throng the mead, when wanes</p>

      <p>The Spring, sweet workshops of the furry bee.</p>

      <p>There sat and sunned him one of giant bulk</p>

      <p>And grisly mien: hard knocks had stov'n his ears:</p>

      <p>Broad were his shoulders, vast his orb&egrave;d chest;</p>

      <p>Like a wrought statue rose his iron frame:</p>

      <p>And nigh the shoulder on each brawny arm</p>

      <p>Stood out the muscles, huge as rolling stones</p>

      <p>Caught by some rain-swoln river and shapen smooth</p>

      <p>By its wild eddyings: and o'er nape and spine</p>

      <p>Hung, balanced by the claws, a lion's skin.</p>

      <p>First there was much manoeuvring, who should catch</p>

      <p>The sunlight on his rear: but thou didst foil,</p>

      <p>O Polydeuces, valour by address;</p>

      <p>And full on Amycus' face the hot noon smote.</p>

      <p>He in hot wrath strode forward, threatening war;</p>

      <p>Straightway the Tyndarid smote him, as he closed,</p>

      <p>Full on the chin: more furious waxed he still,</p>

      <p>Parlous albeit: till, reeling with his wounds,</p>

      <p>He stood, and from his lips spat crimson blood.</p>

      <p>The lips and jowl all seamed with piteous scars,</p>

      <p>And the swoln visage and the half-closed eyes.</p>

      <p>Still the prince teased him, feinting here or there</p>

      <p>A thrust; and when he saw him helpless all,</p>

      <p>Let drive beneath his eyelids at his nose,</p>

      <p>And laid it bare to the bone. The stricken man</p>

      <p>Measured his length supine amid the fern.</p>

      <p>Keen was the fighting when he rose again,</p>

      <p>Deadly the blows their sturdy gauntlets dealt.</p>

      <p>But while Bebrycia's chieftain sparred round chest</p>

      <p>While the one sweated all his bulk away,</p>

      <p>And, late a giant, seemed a pigmy now,</p>

      <p>In semblance and in size. But in what wise</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Whence, sirs, this lust for strife? Why, sword in
      hand,</p>

      <p>Raise ye this coil about your neighbours' wives?</p>

      <p>To us Leucippus these his daughters gave,</p>

      <p>Ye, coveting (to your shame) your neighbour's bed</p>

      <p>And kine and asses and whatever is his,</p>

      <p>Suborned the man and stole our wives by bribes.</p>

      <p>'Not thus, fair sirs, do honourable men</p>

      <p>And Argos and Messene and the towns</p>

      <p>To westward, and the long Sisyphian reach.</p>

      <p>There 'neath her parents' roof dwells many a maid</p>

      <p>Second to none in godliness or wit:</p>

      <p>Wed of all these, and welcome, whom ye will,</p>

      <p>Nay, sirs, but let us bring this thing to pass;</p>

      <p>Lodged ere a blow was struck, and snapt in twain.</p>

      <p>Then they unsheathed their swords, and framed new
      modes</p>

      <p>Of slaughter: pause or respite there was none.</p>

      <p>Oft Castor on broad shield and plum&egrave;d helm</p>

      <p>Lit, and oft keen-eyed Lynceus pierced his shield,</p>

      <p>Or grazed his crest of crimson. But anon,</p>

      <p>As Lynceus aimed his blade at Castor's knee,</p>

      <p>Back with the left sprang Castor and struck off</p>

      <p>His fingers: from the maimed limb dropped the sword.</p>

      <p>And, flying straightway, for his father's tomb</p>

      <p>He made, where gallant Idas sat and saw</p>

      <p>The battle of the brethren. But the child</p>

      <p>Of Zeus rushed in, and with his broadsword drave</p>

      <p>Through flank and navel, sundering with swift stroke</p>

      <p>His vitals: Lynceus tottered and he fell,</p>

      <p>And o'er his eyelids rushed the dreamless sleep.</p>

      <p>Nor did their mother see her elder son</p>

      <p>Come a fair bridegroom to his Cretan home.</p>

      <p>For Idas wrenched from off the dead man's tomb</p>

      <p>A jutting slab, to hurl it at the man</p>

      <p>Who had slain his brother. Then did Zeus bring aid,</p>

      <p>And struck the marble fabric from his grasp,</p>

      <p>And with red lightning burned his frame to dust.</p>

      <p>So doth he fight with odds who dares provoke</p>

      <p>The Tyndarids, mighty sons of mighty sire.</p>

      <p>Now farewell, Leda's children: prosper aye</p>

      <p>The songs I sing. What minstrel loves not well</p>

      <p>The Tyndarids, and Helen, and the chiefs</p>

      <p>That trod Troy down for Menel&auml;us' sake?</p>

      <p>The bard of Chios wrought your royal deeds</p>

      <p>Into his lays, who sang of Priam's state,</p>

      <p>And fights 'neath Ilion's walls; of sailor Greeks,</p>

      <p>And of Achilles towering in the strife.</p>

      <p>Yet take from me whate'er of clear sweet song</p>

      <p>The Muse accords me, even all my store!</p>

      <p>The gods' most precious gift is minstrelsy.</p>

      <br>

      <p>A lad deep-dipt in passion pined for one</p>

      <p class="i2">Whose mood was froward as her face was
      fair.</p>

      <p>Lovers she loathed, for tenderness she had none:</p>

      <p class="i2">Ne'er knew what Love was like, nor how he
      bare</p>

      <p>A bow, and arrows to make young maids smart:</p>

      <p>Proof to all speech, all access, seemed her heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>So he found naught his furnace to allay;</p>

      <p class="i2">No quiver of lips, no lighting of kind
      eyes,</p>

      <p>Nor rose-flushed cheek; no talk, no lover's play</p>

      <p class="i2">Was deigned him: but as forest-beasts are
      shy</p>

      <p>Of hound and hunter, with this wight dealt she;</p>

      <p>Fierce was her lip, her eyes gleamed ominously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Her tyrant's-heart was imaged in her face,</p>

      <p class="i2">That flushed, then altering put on blank
      disdain.</p>

      <p>Yet, even then, her anger had its grace,</p>

      <p class="i2">And made her lover fall in love again.</p>

      <p>At last, unable to endure his flame,</p>

      <p>To the fell threshold all in tears he came:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Kissed it, and lifted up his voice and said:</p>

      <p class="i2">"O heart of stone, O curst and cruel maid</p>

      <p>Unworthy of all love, by lions bred,</p>

      <p class="i2">See, my last offering at thy feet is laid,</p>

      <p>The halter that shall hang me! So no more</p>

      <p>For my sake, lady, need thy heart be sore.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Whither thou doom'st me, thither must I fare.</p>

      <p class="i2">There is a path, that whoso treads hath
      ease</p>

      <p>(Men say) from love; Forgetfulness is there.</p>

      <p class="i2">But if I drain that chalice to the lees,</p>

      <p>I may not quench the love I have for you;</p>

      <p>Now at your gates I cast my long adieu.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Your future I foresee. The rose is gay,</p>

      <p class="i2">And passing-sweet the violet of the spring:</p>

      <p>Yet time despoils them, and they soon decay.</p>

      <p class="i2">The lily droops and dies, that lustrous
      thing;</p>

      <p>The solid-seeming snowdrift melts full fast;</p>

      <p>And maiden's bloom is rare, but may not last.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The time shall come, when you shall feel as I;</p>

      <p class="i2">And, with seared heart, weep many a bitter
      tear.</p>

      <p>But, maiden, grant one farewell courtesy.</p>

      <p class="i2">When you come forth, and see me hanging
      here,</p>

      <p>E'en at your door, forget not my hard case;</p>

      <p>But pause and weep me for a moment's space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And drop one tear, and cut me down, and spread</p>

      <p class="i2">O'er me some garment, for a funeral pall,</p>

      <p>That wrapped thy limbs: and kiss me&mdash;let the dead</p>

      <p class="i2">Be privileged thus highly&mdash;last of
      all.</p>

      <p>You need not fear me: not if your disdain</p>

      <p>Changed into fondness could I live again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And scoop a grave, to hide my loves and me:</p>

      <p class="i2">And thrice, at parting, say, 'My friend's no
      more:'</p>

      <p>Add if you list, 'a faithful friend was he;'</p>

      <p class="i2">And write this epitaph, scratched upon your
      door:</p>

      <p><i>Stranger, Love slew him. Pass not by, until</i></p>

      <p><i>Thou hast paused and said, 'His mistress used him
      ill</i>.'"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>This said, he grasped a stone: that ghastly stone</p>

      <p class="i2">At the mid threshold 'neath the wall he
      laid,</p>

      <p>And o'er the beam the light cord soon was thrown,</p>

      <p class="i2">And his neck noosed. In air the body
      swayed,</p>

      <p>Its footstool spurned away. Forth came once more</p>

      <p>The maid, and saw him hanging at her door.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>No struggle of heart it cost her, ne'er a tear</p>

      <p class="i2">She wept o'er that young life, nor shunned to
      soil,</p>

      <p>By contact with the corpse, her woman's-gear.</p>

      <p class="i2">But on she went to watch the athletes'
      toil,</p>

      <p>Then made for her loved haunt, the riverside:</p>

      <p>And there she met the god she had defied.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For on a marble pedestal Eros stood</p>

      <p class="i2">Fronting the pool: the statue leaped, and
      smote</p>

      <p>And slew that miscreant. All the stream ran blood;</p>

      <p class="i2">And to the top a girl's cry seemed to
      float.</p>

      <p>Rejoice, O lovers, since the scorner fell;</p>

      <p>And, maids, be kind; for Love deals justice well.</p>

    The Infant Heracles.

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="i2">Alcmena once had washed and given the
      breast</p>

      <p>To Heracles, a babe of ten months old,</p>

      <p>And Iphicles his junior by a night;</p>

      <p>And cradled both within a brazen shield,</p>

      <p>A gorgeous trophy, which Amphitryon erst</p>

      <p>Had stript from Pterel&auml;us fall'n in fight.</p>

      <p>She stroked their baby brows, and thus she said:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"Sleep, children mine, a light luxurious
      sleep,</p>

      <p>Brother with brother: sleep, my boys, my life:</p>

      <p>Blest in your slumber, in your waking blest!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">She spake and rocked the shield; and in his
      arms</p>

      <p>Sleep took them. But at midnight, when the Bear</p>

      <p>Wheels to his setting, in Orion's front</p>

      <p>Whose shoulder then beams broadest; Hera sent,</p>

      <p>Mistress of wiles, two huge and hideous things,</p>

      <p>Snakes with their scales of azure all on end,</p>

      <p>To the broad portal of the chamber-door,</p>

      <p>All to devour the infant Heracles.</p>

      <p>They, all their length uncoiled upon the floor,</p>

      <p>Writhed on to their blood-feast; a baleful light</p>

      <p>Gleamed in their eyes, rank venom they spat forth.</p>

      <p>But when with lambent tongues they neared the cot,</p>

      <p>Alcmena's babes (for Zeus was watching all)</p>

      <p>Woke, and throughout the chamber there was light.</p>

      <p>Then Iphicles&mdash;so soon as he descried</p>

      <p>The fell brutes peering o'er the hollow shield,</p>

      <p>And saw their merciless fangs&mdash;cried lustily,</p>

      <p>And kicked away his coverlet of down,</p>

      <p>Fain to escape. But Heracles, he clung</p>

      <p>Round them with warlike hands, in iron grasp</p>

      <p>Prisoning the two: his clutch upon their throat,</p>

      <p>The deadly snake's laboratory, where</p>

      <p>He brews such poisons as e'en heaven abhors.</p>

      <p>They twined and twisted round the babe that, born</p>

      <p>After long travail, ne'er had shed a tear</p>

      <p>E'en in his nursery; soon to quit their hold,</p>

      <p>For powerless seemed their spines. Alcmena heard,</p>

      <p>While her lord slept, the crying, and awoke.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"Amphitryon, up: chill fears take hold on
      me.</p>

      <p>Up: stay not to put sandals on thy feet.</p>

      <p>Hear'st thou our child, our younger, how he cries?</p>

      <p>Seest thou yon walls illumed at dead of night,</p>

      <p>But not by morn's pure beam? I know, I know,</p>

      <p>Sweet lord, that some strange thing is happening
      here."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">She spake; and he, upleaping at her call,</p>

      <p>Made swiftly for the sword of quaint device</p>

      <p>That aye hung dangling o'er his cedarn couch:</p>

      <p>And he was reaching at his span-new belt,</p>

      <p>The scabbard (one huge piece of lotus-wood)</p>

      <p>Poised on his arm; when suddenly the night</p>

      <p>Spread out her hands, and all was dark again.</p>

      <p>Then cried he to his slaves, whose sleep was deep:</p>

      <p>"Quick, slaves of mine; fetch fire from yonder hearth:</p>

      <p>And force with all your strength the doorbolts back!</p>

      <p>Up, loyal-hearted slaves: the master calls."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Forth came at once the slaves with lighted
      lamps.</p>

      <p>The house was all astir with hurrying feet.</p>

      <p>But when they saw the suckling Heracles</p>

      <p>With the two brutes grasped firm in his soft hands,</p>

      <p>They shouted with one voice. But he must show</p>

      <p>The reptiles to Amphitryon; held aloft</p>

      <p>His hands in childish glee, and laughed and laid</p>

      <p>At his sire's feet the monsters still in death.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Then did Alcmena to her bosom take</p>

      <p>The terror-blanched and passionate Iphicles:</p>

      <p>Cradling the other in a lambswool quilt,</p>

      <p>Her lord once more bethought him of his rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Now cocks had thrice sung out that night was
      e'er.</p>

      <p>Then went Alcmena forth and told the thing</p>

      <p>To Teiresias the seer, whose words were truth,</p>

      <p>And bade him rede her what the end should be:&mdash;</p>

      <p>'And if the gods bode mischief, hide it not,</p>

      <p>Pitying, from me: man shall not thus avoid</p>

      <p>The doom that Fate upon her distaff spins.</p>

      <p>Son of Eueres, thou hast ears to hear.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Thus spake the queen, and thus he made
      reply:</p>

      <p>"Mother of monarchs, Perseus' child, take heart;</p>

      <p>And look but on the fairer side of things.</p>

      <p>For by the precious light that long ago</p>

      <p>Left tenantless these eyes, I swear that oft</p>

      <p>Achaia's maidens, as when eve is high</p>

      <p>They mould the silken yarn upon their lap,</p>

      <p>Shall tell Alcmena's story: blest art thou</p>

      <p>Of women. Such a man in this thy son</p>

      <p>Shall one day scale the star-encumbered heaven:</p>

      <p>His amplitude of chest bespeaks him lord</p>

      <p>Of all the forest beasts and all mankind.</p>

      <p>Twelve tasks accomplished he must dwell with Zeus;</p>

      <p>His flesh given over to Trachinian fires;</p>

      <p>And son-in-law be hailed of those same gods</p>

      <p>Who sent yon skulking brutes to slay thy babe.</p>

      <p>Lo! the day cometh when the fawn shall couch</p>

      <p>In the wolfs lair, nor fear the spiky teeth</p>

      <p>That would not harm him. But, O lady, keep</p>

      <p>Yon smouldering fire alive; prepare you piles</p>

      <p>Of fuel, bramble-sprays or fern or furze</p>

      <p>Or pear-boughs dried with swinging in the wind:</p>

      <p>And let the kindled wild-wood burn those snakes</p>

      <p>At midnight, when they looked to slay thy babe.</p>

      <p>And let at dawn some handmaid gather up</p>

      <p>The ashes of the fire, and diligently</p>

      <p>Convey and cast each remnant o'er the stream</p>

      <p>Faced by clov'n rocks, our boundary: then return</p>

      <p>Nor look behind. And purify your home</p>

      <p>First with sheer sulphur, rain upon it then,</p>

      <p>(Chaplets of olive wound about your heads,)</p>

      <p>Innocuous water, and the customed salt.</p>

      <p>Lastly, to Zeus almighty slay a boar:</p>

      <p>So shall ye vanquish all your enemies."</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Spake Teiresias, and wheeling (though his

      <p>Whereon he sat came still unshattered home,</p>

      <p>Or, on the warpath, place his ambuscade,</p>

      <p>Marshal his lines and rally his cavaliers;</p>

      <p>Well do the delvers know, whose busy feet</p>

      <p>Troop to his wine-vats in fair summer-time.</p>

      <p>Yea, all these acres wise Aug&eacute;as owns,</p>

      <p>These corn-clad uplands and these orchards green,</p>

      <p>Far as yon ledges whence the cataracts leap.</p>

      <p>Some honoured master-worker in the fields,</p>

      <p>For who can fathom all his fellow's mind?</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">The dogs perceived their coming, yet far

      <p>Ran at Amphitryon's son: but feebly whined</p>

      <p>And fawned upon the old man at his side.</p>

      <p>Then Heracles, just lifting from the ground</p>

      <p>A pebble, scared them home, and with hard words</p>

      <p>Cursed the whole pack; and having stopped their din</p>

      <p>(Inly rejoiced, nathless, to see them guard</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">He spake: the dogs ran scurrying to their
      lairs.</p>

      <p>And now the sun wheeled round his westering car</p>

      <p>And led still evening on: from every field</p>

      <p>Came thronging the fat flocks to bield and byre.</p>

      <p>Then in their thousands, drove on drove, the kine</p>

      <p>Came into view; as rainclouds, onward driven</p>

      <p>By stress of gales, the west or mighty north,</p>

      <p>Come up o'er all the heaven; and none may count</p>

      <p>And naught may stay them as they sweep through air;</p>

      <p>Such multitudes the storm's strength drives ahead,</p>

      <p>Such multitudes climb surging in the rear&mdash;</p>

      <p>So in swift sequence drove succeeded drove,</p>

      <p>And all the champaign, all the highways swarmed</p>

      <p>With tramping oxen; all the sumptuous leas</p>

      <p>Rang with their lowing. Soon enough the stalls</p>

      <p>Were populous with the laggard-footed kine,</p>

      <p>Soon did the sheep lie folded in their folds.</p>

      <p>Then of that legion none stood idle, none</p>

      <p>Gaped listless at the herd, with naught to do:</p>

      <p>But one drew near and milked them, binding clogs</p>

      <p>Of wood with leathern thongs around their feet:</p>

      <p>One brought, all hungering for the milk they loved,</p>

      <p>The longing young ones to the longing dams.</p>

      <p>One held the pail, one pressed the dainty cheese,</p>

      <p>Or drove the bulls home, sundered from the kine.</p>

      <p>Pacing from stall to stall, Aug&eacute;as saw</p>

      <p>What revenue his herdsman brought him in.</p>

      <p>With him his son surveyed the royal wealth,</p>

      <p>And, strong of limb and purpose, Heracles.</p>

      <p>Then, though the heart within him was as steel,</p>

      <p>Framed to withstand all shocks, Amphitryon's son</p>

      <p>Gazed in amazement on those thronging kine;</p>

      <p>For none had deemed or dreamed that one, or ten,</p>

      <p>Whose wealth was more than regal, owned those tribes:</p>

      <p>Such huge largess the Sun had given his child,</p>

      <p>First of mankind for multitude of flocks.</p>

      <p>The Sun himself gave increase day by day</p>

      <p>To his child's herds: whatever diseases spoil</p>

      <p>The farmer, came not there; his kine increased</p>

      <p>In multitude and value year by year:</p>

      <p>None cast her young, or bare unfruitful males.</p>

      <p>Three hundred bulls, white-pasterned, crumple-horned,</p>

      <p>Ranged amid these, and eke two hundred roans,</p>

      <p>Sires of a race to be: and twelve besides</p>

      <p>Herded amongst them, sacred to the Sun.</p>

      <p>Their skin was white as swansdown, and they moved</p>

      <p>Like kings amid the beasts of laggard foot.</p>

      <p>Scorning the herd in uttermost disdain</p>

      <p>They cropped the green grass in untrodden fields:</p>

      <p>And when from the dense jungle to the plain</p>

      <p>Leapt a wild beast, in quest of vagrant cows;</p>

      <p>Scenting him first, the twelve went forth to war.</p>

      <p>Stern was their bellowing, in their eye sat death,</p>

      <p>Foremost of all for mettle and for might</p>

      <p>And pride of heart loomed Phaeton: him the swains</p>

      <p>Regarded as a star; so bright he shone</p>

      <p>Among the herd, the cynosure of eyes.</p>

      <p>He, soon as he descried the sun-dried skin</p>

      <p>Of the grim lion, made at Heracles</p>

      <p>(Whose eye was on him)&mdash;fain to make his crest</p>

      <p>And sturdy brow acquainted with his flanks.</p>

      <p>Straight the prince grasped him with no tender grasp</p>

      <p>By the left horn, and bowed that giant bulk</p>

      <p>To earth, neck foremost: then, by pressure brought</p>

      <p>To bear upon his shoulder, forced him back.</p>

      <p>The web of muscles that enwraps the nerves</p>

      <p>Stood out from the brute's fore-arm plain to see.</p>

      <p>Marvelled the King, and Phyleus his brave son,</p>

      <p>At the strange prowess of Amphitryon's child.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Then townwards, leaving straight that rich

      <p>And soon as they had gained the paven road,</p>

      <p>Making their way hotfooted o'er a path</p>

      <p>(Not o'er-conspicuous in the dim green wood)</p>

      <p>That left the farm and threaded through the vines,</p>

      <p>Out-spake unto the child of Zeus most high,</p>

      <p>Who followed in his steps, Aug&eacute;as' son,</p>

      <p>O'er his right shoulder glancing pleasantly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"O stranger, as some old familiar tale</p>

      <p>I seem to cast thy history in my mind.</p>

      <p>For there came one to Argos, young and tall,</p>

      <p>By birth a Greek from Helic&egrave;-on-seas,</p>

      <p>Who told this tale before a multitude:</p>

      <p>How that an Argive in his presence slew</p>

      <p>A fearful lion-beast, the dread and death</p>

      <p>Of herdsmen; which inhabited a den</p>

      <p>Or cavern by the grove of Nemean Zeus.</p>

      <p>He may have come from sacred Argos' self,</p>

      <p>Or Tiryns, or Mycen&aelig;: what know I?</p>

      <p>But thus he told his tale, and said the slayer</p>

      <p>Was (if my memory serves me) Perseus' son.</p>

      <p>Methinks no islander had dared that deed</p>

      <p>Save thee: the lion's skin that wraps thy ribs</p>

      <p>Argues full well some gallant feat of arms.</p>

      <p>But tell me, warrior, first&mdash;that I may know</p>

      <p>If my prophetic soul speak truth or not&mdash;</p>

      <p>Art thou the man of whom that stranger Greek</p>

      <p>Spoke in my hearing? Have I guessed aright?</p>

      <p>How slew you single-handed that fell beast?</p>

      <p>How came it among rivered Nemea's glens?</p>

      <p>For none such monster could the eagerest eye</p>

      <p>Find in all Greece: Greece harbours bear and boar,</p>

      <p>And deadly wolf: but not this larger game.</p>

      <p>'Twas this that made his listeners marvel then:</p>

      <p>They deemed he told them travellers' tales, to win</p>

      <p>By random words applause from standers-by."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Then Phyleus from the mid-road edged away,</p>

      <p>That both might walk abreast, and he might catch</p>

      <p>More at his ease what fell from Heracles:</p>

      <p>Who journeying now alongside thus began:&mdash;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"On the prior matter, O Aug&eacute;as'
      child,</p>

      <p>Thine own unaided wit hath ruled aright.</p>

      <p>But all that monster's history, how it fell,</p>

      <p>Fain would I tell thee who hast ears to hear,</p>

      <p>Save only whence it came: for none of all</p>

      <p>The Argive host could read that riddle right.</p>

      <p>Some god, we dimly guessed, our niggard vows</p>

      <p>Resenting, had upon Phoroneus' realm</p>

      <p>Let loose this very scourge of humankind.</p>

      <p>On peopled Pisa plunging like a flood</p>

      <p>The brute ran riot: notably it cost</p>

      <p>Its neighbours of Bembina woes untold.</p>

      <p>And here Eurystheus bade me try my first</p>

      <p>Passage of arms, and slay that fearsome thing.</p>

      <p>So with my buxom bow and quiver lined</p>

      <p>With arrows I set forth: my left hand held</p>

      <p>My club, a beetling olive's stalwart trunk</p>

      <p>And shapely, still environed in its bark:</p>

      <p>This hand had torn from holiest Helicon</p>

      <p>The tree entire, with all its fibrous roots.</p>

      <p>And finding soon the lion's whereabouts,</p>

      <p>I grasped my bow, and on the bent horn slipped</p>

      <p>The string, and laid thereon the shaft of death.</p>

      <p>And, now all eyes, I watched for that fell thing,</p>

      <p>In hopes to view him ere he spied out me.</p>

      <p>But midday came, and nowhere could I see</p>

      <p>One footprint of the beast or hear his roar:</p>

      <p>And, trust me, none appeared of whom to ask,</p>

      <p>Herdsman or labourer, in the furrowed lea;</p>

      <p>For wan dismay kept each man in his hut.</p>

      <p>Still on I footed, searching through and through</p>

      <p>The leafy mountain-passes, till I saw</p>

      <p>The creature, and forthwith essayed my strength.</p>

      <p>Gorged from some gory carcass, on he stalked</p>

      <p>At eve towards his lair; his grizzled mane,</p>

      <p>Shoulders, and grim glad visage, all adrip</p>

      <p>With carnage; and he licked his bearded lips.</p>

      <p>I, crouched among the shadows of the trees</p>

      <p>On the green hill-top, waited his approach,</p>

      <p>And as he came I aimed at his left flank.</p>

      <p>The barb&egrave;d shaft sped idly, nor could pierce</p>

      <p>The flesh, but glancing dropped on the green grass.</p>

      <p>He, wondering, raised forthwith his tawny head,</p>

      <p>And ran his eyes o'er all the vicinage,</p>

      <p>And snarled and gave to view his cavernous throat.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile I levelled yet another shaft,</p>

      <p>Ill pleased to think my first had fled in vain.</p>

      <p>In the mid-chest I smote him, where the lungs</p>

      <p>Are seated: still the arrow sank not in,</p>

      <p>But fell, its errand frustrate, at his feet.</p>

      <p>Once more was I preparing, sore chagrined,</p>

      <p>To draw the bowstring, when the ravenous beast</p>

      <p>Glaring around espied me, lashed his sides</p>

      <p>With his huge tail, and opened war at once.</p>

      <p>Swelled his vast neck, his dun locks stood on end</p>

      <p>With rage: his spine moved sinuous as a bow,</p>

      <p>Till all his weight hung poised on flank and loin.</p>

      <p>And e'en as, when a chariot-builder bends</p>

      <p>With practised skill his shafts of splintered fig,</p>

      <p>Hot from the fire, to be his axle-wheels;</p>

      <p>Flies the tough-rinded sapling from the hands</p>

      <p>That shape it, at a bound recoiling far:</p>

      <p>So from far-off the dread beast, all of a heap,</p>

      <p>Sprang on me, hungering for my life-blood. I</p>

      <p>Thrust with one hand my arrows in his face</p>

      <p>And my doffed doublet, while the other raised</p>

      <p>My seasoned cudgel o'er his crest, and drave</p>

      <p>Full at his temples, breaking clean in twain</p>

      <p>On the fourfooted warrior's airy scalp</p>

      <p>My club; and ere he reached me, down he fell.</p>

      <p>Headlong he fell, and poised on tremulous feet</p>

      <p>Stood, his head wagging, and his eyes grown dim;</p>

      <p>For the shrewd stroke had shattered brain and bone.</p>

      <p>I, marking him beside himself with pain.</p>

      <p>Fell, ere recovering he should breathe again,</p>

      <p>At vantage on his solid sinewy neck,</p>

      <p>My bow and woven quiver thrown aside.</p>

      <p>With iron clasp I gripped him from the rear</p>

      <p>(His talons else had torn me) and, my foot</p>

      <p>Set on him, forced to earth by dint of heel</p>

      <p>His hinder parts, my flanks entrenched the while</p>

      <p>Behind his fore-arm; till his thews were stretched</p>

      <p>And strained, and on his haunches stark he stood</p>

      <p>And lifeless; hell received his monstrous ghost.</p>

      <p>Then with myself I counselled how to strip</p>

      <p>From off the dead beast's limbs his shaggy hide,</p>

      <p>A task full onerous, since I found it proof</p>

      <p>Against all blows of steel or stone or wood.</p>

      <p>Some god at last inspired me with the thought,</p>

      <p>With his own claws to rend the lion's skin.</p>

      <p>With these I flayed him soon, and sheathed and armed</p>

      <p>My limbs against the shocks of murderous war.</p>

      <p>Thus, sir, the Nemean lion met his end,</p>

      <p>Erewhile the constant curse of beast and man."</p>

      <p>My soul's treasured secret to you I'll impart;</p>

      <p>It is this; that I never won fairly your heart.</p>

      <p>One half of my life, I am conscious, has flown;</p>

      <p>The residue lives on your image alone.</p>

      <p>You are kind, and I dream I'm in paradise then;</p>

      fast.</p>

      <p>Reflect, ere you spurn me, that youth at his sides</p>

      <p>Ah for this the most accursed, unendurable of ills!</p>

      <p>Nigh two months a fevered fancy for a maid my bosom
      fills.</p>

      <p>Fair she is, as other damsels: but for what the simplest
      swain</p>

      <p>Claims from the demurest maiden, I must sue and sue in
      vain.</p>

      <p>Yet doth now this thing of evil my longsuffering heart

      smile:</p>

      <p>And I soon shall know no respite, have no solace e'en in
      sleep.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I watched her pass me, and from down-dropt
      eyelids peep</p>

      <p>At the face she dared not gaze on&mdash;every moment
      blushing more&mdash;</p>

      <p>And my love took hold upon me as it never took before.</p>

      <p>Home I went a wounded creature, with a gnawing at my

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
